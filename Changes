Changes
=======

1.00_02 - Mar 26 2012
    - Beef up the docs extensively.
    - Remove other croak() calls, make sure to set $!
    - Add zmq_errno(), zmq_strerror()
    - zmq_send(), zmq_recv() are now pure perl wrappers around _zmq_send() 
      and z_zmq_recv()
    - Make sure to emulate libzmq2 errors for stuff like trying to act upon
      closed cxt, sockets, and messages, since we don't call the C level
      functions when we detect that they have been closed from the Perl level.

1.00_01 - Mar 24 2012
    - Initial release.
